          <li>However, they may require more attention while making a deal to account for undercuts or buyouts.</li>
          <li>There are many ways to acquire the materials needed to craft a legendary weapon more cheaply than the trading post. Trading a weapon at 85% for materials at 90% allows both sides to make a profit.</li>
          <li>Check the price history graph on GW2BLTC using the links in the table below to see where the sell price is most of the time. If it undercut rarely, and returns to the previous price quickly, then undercuts of 1-2 items
            can be ignored. If the undercut is more persistent, or involves a larger quantity, then that lower price should be used for trading. Either way, multiply by 85%.</li>
          <li>Occasionally, some weapons will trade at a higher price than 85%. This generally happens only with "meta" weapons - ones that are used in a lot of builds - and only if the buyer is motivated to buy. 86-87% is possible,
            any higher is exceedingly rare.</li>
          <li>See <a href="/docs/">our about prices page</a> for more information about item valuations.</li>
